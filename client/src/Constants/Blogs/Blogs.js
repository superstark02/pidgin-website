            <p>The National Testing Agency is going to conduc JEE Main 2020 from September (tentative). Both the papers of JEE Main 2019 i.e., Paper I and Paper II will be conducted in computer based test mode (except for Drawing Section of Paper II). Most of the students think offline mode of examination is better than online mode. That&rsquo;s why appearing candidates are searching for the best way to attempt the online test. Here, we are providing the most important tips which will help JEE Main aspirants to perform well in the computer based test conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA).</p>
            <p><strong>Let's study about these tips in detail:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>1. Read all the instruction very carefully:</strong></p>
            <p>First of all students should read all the instructions that appear on the computer screen at the time of exam. Sometimes students think reading instructions will waste their time. But students get extra time for reading instructions apart from 3 hours.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Make strategies after reading the complete question paper only:</strong></p>
            <p>To view the complete question paper, students can click on the &ldquo;Question Paper&rdquo; on the right side at the top. After going through the complete paper, students will get an idea about the difficulty level of all the subjects. Thereafter, students can easily make the strategies to attempt the paper.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Read the complete question:</strong></p>
            <p>Sometimes the question may be lengthy enough which makes it impossible to appear the complete questions on the screen at a time. Therefore, students must read the complete question with the help of the scroll button of mouse before attempting the question.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Use the options of changing language if not able to understand the question:</strong></p>
            <p>If students face difficulty in understanding the question, then they can change the language of that particular question. After understanding the question, students should start solving the questions but they should remember that time is very crucial. If JEE Main aspirants are not 100% sure about the answer then, they should leave that question and go for next question.</p>
            <p><strong>5. Note all the values very carefully in your rough sheet:</strong></p>
            <p>In JEE Main Computer Based Test 2019, students will have to do each and every calculation on their rough sheet. Thus, students must be very conscious while transferring data from computer screen to rough sheet. Taking incorrect value will gave them wrong answer and will waste their precious time.</p>
            <p><strong>6. Use Save &amp; Mark for Review when you have any doubt:</strong></p>
            <p>If engineering aspirants have any doubt after solving the questions then, they can use&nbsp;<strong>Save &amp; Mark for Review</strong>&nbsp;option. This option will change the color of the question number in the question template on the right side. Students can visit these questions in one go when they have time remaining before the exam.</p>
            <p><strong>7. Don&rsquo;t panic in case of computer failure:</strong></p>
            <p>Sometimes system may get shutdown due to some technical glitches. In such conditions student don&rsquo;t panic. The exam will resume from the same point. Therefore, students don&rsquo;t lose their concentration and try to remain focused.</p>
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
            <p>We hope that, the above tips will help students in getting good marks in JEE Main CBT 2019. Apart from these tips, appearing candidates must attempt&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jagranjosh.com/articles/jee-main-free-online-mock-test-series-by-nta-1513754666-1" target="_blank"><strong>Mock Test</strong></a>&nbsp;for JEE Main 2019 released by the National Testing Agency.

            <p><strong>1. Make Use of the Revision Notes and Flashcards Regularly</strong></p>
            <p>While revising any unit go through your previously prepared notes. This process will help you to strengthen concepts in your memory and hence, applying them becomes much easier. If you haven&rsquo;t prepared flashcards in past then don&rsquo;t waste time in preparing them now. Although flashcards would&rsquo;ve made it easier for recollection, your notes will also suffice.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Prepare a Proper Study Time-table and Stick To It</strong></p>
            <p>Understand each and every topic included in the&nbsp;<a href="https://byjus.com/jee/jee-syllabus/">JEE Syllabus</a>&nbsp;and accordingly formulate a proper study plan. Schedule all your breaks, sleep cycle and study time in this timetable and make sure you stick to it. Set goals and include it as a part of your schedule.

Set appropriate time limits to practice questions and ensure that it helps in managing time during the actual JEE Exam.</p>
            <p><strong>3. At the time of Revision, Don&rsquo;t Focus on Learning Anything New</strong></p>
            <p>As mentioned above, your revision time should only be used to revise units that you have already learned. Don&rsquo;t focus on learning any new concept at this time because learning anything new may also weaken your confidence at this stage.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Practice ample of Past year&rsquo;s Question papers and Mock Tests:</strong></p>
            <p>After studying certain concepts, it is better to practice questions from the past years&rsquo; question papers. It will help you to test or analyze your preparation level for JEE exams. Solving previous years&rsquo; question papers will help you gain higher confidence and it also enhances your exam temperament. Don&rsquo;t forget to attempt sample mock tests. These tests should be attempted to know how to manage time and pressure of the actual examination. Therefore, you should set conditions as an ideal to the actual situation with no distractions. Practice several numbers of application-based questions from previous papers.</p>
            <p><strong>5. Take Breaks and Ensure a Healthy Sleep Cycle:</strong></p>
            <p>Make sure to take enough scheduled breaks and maintain a regular sleep cycle. It is obviously not possible to study for the whole day or night. Since most of the hard work is done by your brain, therefore, you should give it sufficient time to recuperate.

Sufficient rest also keeps you motivated and will make your stay positive during your preparations.7</p>

        image: image4,
        author: 'By GURMEET KAUR, Jagran JOSH',

            <p>Here you will know 10 most effective tips to avoid sleep while studying for long hours. You will know how small changes in your study pattern can help you throw away the drowsiness and study properly for long hours.</p>
            <p>Sleep becomes the biggest hurdle when you have to study for long hours at night to prepare for any important test or exam. It seems like pulling you back from reaching your goal. When you study with a fresh mind in the morning, it becomes really easy to grab the things but at certain periods like in the afternoon and at late night, sleep becomes inevitable as you try to stretch your study hours. Actually, it happens when you are restless. At such times, you are left with two options; first is keeping the books aside and lie down to take rest and second is fighting against the drowsiness to keep yourself awake. But sleeping while studying is too easy, the real deal is to ditch sleep and stay awake.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Here, in this article you will get some useful and lucrative tips that you can follow to avoid sleep while studying for long hours.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>1. Keep your study room well lighted</strong></p>
            <p>The biggest mistake most of the students make is studying with just a table lamp lit in the whole room due to which a significant portion of the room remains dark, promoting a cosy environment which would eventually make you more tempted to go to that charming bed with dim surroundings. So, to avoid such comfy situation, keep your room bright and well lighted.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Sit in a chair, not on bed</strong></p>
            <p>Your sitting position also matters a lot while studying for long hours. Try to seat yourself in a chair with back support and a table in front. It will help you stay active and alert while studying. On the other hand, if you lie on your bed while studying you may get into lazy mode, eventually making you feel sleepy. While sitting on the chair, keep moving your body parts at regular intervals so that you don&rsquo;t go in dormancy.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Avoid heavy meals</strong></p>
            <p>We&rsquo;ve all felt that drowsy feeling that sneaks in after a meal and if you have to study with such snoozing mood than no one can help it. Actually, after having a heavy meal, you are full and relaxed and you are struggling to keep your eyes open.&nbsp;Lethargy that comes after consuming a heavy diet diminishes the retention power. Also, when you feel lazy, you are more likely to hit the bed. But don&rsquo;t think that you will have to go on a starvation to avoid this sluggishness. Instead, you should take your meals early and opt for small meals.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Drink lots of water</strong></p>
            <p>Here, water is being recommended not only to keep you hydrated but also to keep you alert. Actually, it&rsquo;s the best trick that most of the students apply while studying. When you drink a considerable quantity of water, you will have to make frequent trips to bathroom for pee, keeping you moving and alert. Moreover, drinking an adequate quantity of water helps to keep the brain well hydrated, increasing its memory and retention power.</p>
            <p><strong>5. Follow &lsquo;Early to bed, early to rise&rsquo; funda</strong></p>
            <p>This comes from a famous saying, &ldquo;Early to bed, early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise&rdquo;. This is absolutely true because if you manage to go to sleep early in night then you will get adequate sleep, waking up to a fresh and energetic day. With a fresh mind you can concentrate on your studies quite well. A fresh mind has a better concentration power to retain an information.</p>
            <p><strong>6. Take a nap in the afternoon</strong></p>
            <p>If you have been continuously studying since morning, then an afternoon nap is a must to save your brain from getting exhausted. It would also help you avoid sleep during studying at late night. A short nap is enough to keep you alert keeping the drowsiness away.</p>
            <p><strong>7. Keep your body parts alert and awake</strong></p>
            <p>If you keep on studying with the same stagnant position for long hours, then you are more likely to get surrounded by laziness and drowsiness. So, the moment you start feeling sleepy, get up from your chair and move around in your room and stretch your legs and arms. You may study while walking around your room. It has been observed that study while walking, not only helps in avoiding the sleep, but also enhances concentration.</p>
            <p><strong>8. Read out aloud while studying</strong></p>
            <p>This trick works really well to keep away the lethargy. It minimizes the chances of falling asleep while studying. It has something to do with listening to your own voice. Try to teach yourself like the teacher explains a topic in the classroom. This will not only help to throw away the drowsiness, but also to improve your learning power.</p>
            <p><strong>9. Learn by writing</strong></p>
            <p>If you will keep on reading the text to be learned then it will create a monotonous situation due to which you are more likely to start feeling bored which will ultimately give invitation to sleepiness. To keep the lethargy away, you are advised not to merely be a spectator, but learn by writing so that your brain remains active doing the pen and paper work and recalling the things you have learned.</p>
            <p><strong>10. Avoid studying difficult topics at night</strong></p>
            <p>During the night you feel more sluggish if you are solving complex problems or trying to learn the difficult topics. Try to tackle only the light and easy portions of syllabus during night. Leave the tough portions for day time when your body and brain are fresh and active. For the late night study, pick only those topics which are easy, interesting and are your favourite ones.</p>
            <p>So, dear students, if you want to earn those extra grades by sacrificing your sleep, then the above stated tricks will surely help you&nbsp; to meet your desired academic goals.</p>

            <p class="q-text qu-display--block">First thing is that syllabus of chemistry is huge in JEE. I would suggest you to start with NCERT Chemistry XI &amp; XII &amp; then with the other materials you have.</p>
            <p class="q-text qu-display--block">Now follow these steps for each topic you want to memorise :-</p>
            <ul class="q-box">
                <li class="q-relative">Collect Questions :-&nbsp;Start collecting different questions from the topic which you will be reading soon.</li>
                <li class="q-relative">Start Reading :-&nbsp;Forget that you need to memorise things. Just simply start reading the topic with the materials that you have with NCERT.</li>
                <li class="q-relative">Start Solving :-&nbsp;Now this is big time for you, start solving the questions you collected and try to remember the concepts and facts involved.You will not be able to solve all of them.&nbsp;No Worries&nbsp;! because syllabus is huge.</li>
                <li class="q-relative">Move on to the next topic :-&nbsp;Now do all the above three steps for each topics you are aiming to memorise.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="q-text qu-display--block">Now&nbsp;repeat the process&nbsp;for each topic after an interval of 15 days or 1 month as per your convenience. In intial days you will observe the interval time is big, but as soon as time moves on you yourself will find ease in making the interval time small. After enough number of loops which may take a year or two, very soon you will realise you are doing good in chemistry.</p>
            <p class="q-text qu-display--block">To boost up your confidence before JEE start solving previous year&rsquo;s questions.&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t worry if you are not able to solve all of them because you already solved enough of them. And if you are able to solve all of them its excellent.</p>
            <p class="q-text qu-display--block">See many times concepts hit in your brain when you encounter a question involving those respective concepts, so don&rsquo;t worry with the question that whether or not i remember complete chemistry ?</p>
            <p class="q-text qu-display--block">Got my point, now go and start following. All the best. Thank you for reading :)</p>
